# Security

## Supported versions

The latest tagged release. There are no long-lived release branches, so a fix ships in the next tag
rather than being backported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on this repository: <https://github.com/Rethunk-Tech/go-gameproc/security/advisories/new>, or the **Security** tab, then **Report a vulnerability**. The report stays private between you and us until a fix ships.

If private reporting is unavailable, email [oss@rethunk.tech](mailto:oss@rethunk.tech) with **[SECURITY]** in the subject.

Please do not open a public issue, pull request or discussion for a suspected vulnerability.

A useful report has the affected repository and version (or commit), steps to reproduce, what an attacker gets and under which conditions, and whether anyone else knows.

## What counts as a vulnerability

A vulnerability is a flaw that lets someone cross a boundary they should not: run code, read or change data they have no right to, escape a sandbox or path restriction, or leak a credential. A bug is anything else that misbehaves, such as a crash on your own input, wrong output or a slow path; open an ordinary issue for those. If you are unsure which one you have, report it privately and we will say.

## Coordinated disclosure

We handle the report inside the private advisory, so you see each status change and can comment on the fix. The advisory goes public when the fix ships, or 90 days after your report, whichever comes first. If a fix is close, either of us can ask for more time in the thread. You are credited in the advisory unless you would rather not be.

## Response timelines

- We acknowledge your report within 3 business days.
- We give you an assessment (accepted, needs more information or declined, with reasons) within 10 business days.
- We aim to ship a fix within 90 days of the report.

## What is in scope

- Process tables and command lines (`Processes`): another user's process controls its own `argv`. A crafted command
  line must not panic the parser, make a system program match as a game, or reach a path outside the tree handed in.
- The Flatpak host listing (`Processes("/proc", ...)`): its text comes from the host's `grep` and `stat` and is parsed
  with `Cut` and `Fields` only; malformed records are skipped, never indexed blindly.
- Pids (`Terminate`, `KillTree`, `Alive`, `WaitPID`, `TrackTree`, `ImagePath`): `0`, negative values and, for
  `KillTree`, `1` must never reach `kill(2)`, where they signal the caller's own group or every process the user owns.
- The process environment read for the polite Wine close (`Stop`): the variables are passed to `wine taskkill` as read,
  minus `WINESERVERSOCKET`, and only for a pid the caller named.

## What is out of scope

- The caller decides which process to stop. `Terminate` ends whatever process the pid names, if the OS permits; a
  caller that takes a pid from a file must check it is still the program it recorded (`ImagePath`).
- Program names, the install directory and the command to start are trusted: they are never run through a shell.
- Stopping a process the user owns, and a process that outlives its caller, are the purpose of the package.

## Safe harbour

We will not pursue legal action against good-faith research that avoids privacy violations, data destruction and disruption of services, stops at a proof of concept, and keeps the details private until the advisory is published. Rethunk.Tech, LLC maintains this repository.
